# Telecom Revenue Dashboard for Pre and Post 5G levels:

I have completed a Dashboard Project in Power BI for AtliQo, one of the leading telecom providers in India, fictionally. The project involved analyzing the impact of the 5G launch on AtliQo's active user rate and revenue growth. Through simple star schema data model, I was able to provide the management with a comprehensive comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The insights generated from the dashboard enabled the management to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and optimize their internet plans to attract more users. It was an exciting and challenging project, and thanks to @codebasicshub for this project.

Dashboard Snapshots, PDF version and PBIX file is available in this repository. Feel free to download it, and add your visualizations to it. Don't forget to share it with me.
